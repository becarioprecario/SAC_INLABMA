# Bayesian Model Averaging with INLA

This repository contains the code for the following paper:

* V. GÃ³mez-Rubio, R. S. Bivand and H. Ruw (2019). *Bayesian model averaging with the integrated nested Laplace approximation*.

This paper describes how to do Bayesian model averaging with INLA, which
is illustated using the the SAC spatial econometrics model.

These are the files provided:

* `loaddata.RData`, italian turnout in the 2011 ellection in Italy plus adjacency matrix.

* `utils.R`, some configuration options and funcitons required by the main file.

* `analysis.R, main `R` file (i.e., the one you want to run). `n.xy` controls 
  the number of grid points in each dimension and `model.to.run` the model
  to run (`0` for no covariates and `1` for including covariates).
